Work Summary:

**1. Initial Assessment:**
   - Reviewed the project structure and key files: `src/App.tsx` (frontend), `server/index.js` (backend), `package.json` (frontend dependencies), `server/package.json` (backend dependencies).
   - Identified that the `scriptforgemini.txt` file was empty, meaning there were no explicit instructions for continuing previous work.
   - The project is a horoscope application with a React frontend and a Node.js Express backend that scrapes data from `asahi.co.jp`.

**2. Backend Setup (`server/` directory):**
   - **Problem:** The `server/package.json` was missing a `start` script to easily run the backend.
   - **Action:** Added `"start": "node index.js"` to `server/package.json`.
   - **Problem:** `npm install` for backend dependencies failed due to PowerShell execution policy issues (garbled error messages).
   - **Action:** Executed `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force; npm install` in the `server` directory to temporarily bypass the execution policy for the session and install dependencies. This was successful.
   - **Problem:** Attempted to start the backend server in the background using `Start-Process -NoNewWindow npm -ArgumentList "start" -WorkingDirectory "..."` and `Start-Job -ScriptBlock { node index.js } -WorkingDirectory "..."`, both failed due to PowerShell command interpretation or `WorkingDirectory` parameter issues (garbled error messages).
   - **Action:** Successfully started the backend server as a PowerShell background job using `Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Set-Location C:\Users\User\antig\reactpj\astro\server; node index.js }`. The job was confirmed to be running.

**3. Frontend Setup (root directory):**
   - **Problem:** `npm install` for frontend dependencies failed due to PowerShell execution policy issues (garbled error messages).
   - **Action:** Executed `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force; npm install` in the root directory to temporarily bypass the execution policy for the session and install dependencies. This was successful.
   - **Problem:** Attempted to start the frontend development server using `npm run dev` and it failed due to the same PowerShell execution policy issues.
   - **Action:** The user cancelled the operation when prompted to execute `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force; npm run dev`.

**Current Status:**
- Backend dependencies are installed and the server is running in a PowerShell background job.
- Frontend dependencies are installed.
- The frontend development server (`npm run dev`) has not yet been started because the last attempt was cancelled by the user.

**Next Steps (Pending User Instruction):**
- Start the frontend development server.
- Verify full application functionality (data fetching, display, language switching).
- Investigate and potentially implement the "lucky item" parsing/display logic in `App.tsx`.
- Review Cheerio version and potential scraping improvements.
